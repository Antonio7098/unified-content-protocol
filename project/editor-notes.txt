can you make it so that i can add semantic links on the graph. when i hover, an icon pops up, and when i drag it to another block it hooks on and a modal appears to choose the link. 

make all things have the same level of visual nesting int he editor, or have the option to toggle. 

make the graph hover modal nicer. a little icon on the graph that opens a modal that shows the block content, allows edit, ect...

what about extending types to h1, h2, ect... i know we had a semantic role field. so that we can display them dirrerently in the editor? what about bullet lists? how do we deal with them?

Here’s a breakdown of each request from @editor-notes.txt with recommended next steps:

Graph semantic links via drag-to-connect
Need UI affordance on each graph node (hover-revealed icon) that enters a “link mode” and performs drag connections.
Implementation outline:
Extend graph data layer to surface available semantic link types (probably reuse existing EdgeType definitions).
Add hover overlay with a draggable handle; integrate with existing drag state but scoped to link creation.
On drop, open a modal (likely React dialog) that lists link types + metadata fields; once confirmed, call store method to add edge.
Considerations: conflict resolution with block drag/drop, keyboard accessibility, undo/redo integration.
Consistent visual nesting / toggle
Current block tree uses indentation + vertical lines; bullet alternatives look uneven.
Proposal: introduce a “flat vs hierarchical” toggle in editor config (persisted per user). In flat mode, each block gets uniform left padding and relies on semantic cues (e.g., subheading badges) instead of indentation.
Requires:
New store config flag (e.g., enableNestingIndentation).
Conditional styles in BlockRenderer children container.
Optional toolbar toggle so writers can switch easily.
Graph hover modal improvements
Ask: replace current raw tooltip with richer preview+actions.
Suggested flow:
Add small “info” icon anchored to node (similar style to inline block controls).
Clicking opens side modal/popover showing block title/content, quick edit button, metadata chips.
Reuse BlockEditor in read-only mode or add lightweight summary card.
Action items: design pass for layout, ensure it doesn’t interfere with drag gestures, consider lazy loading content for performance.
Extended block types (H1/H2 etc.) & bullet lists
Already have semantic roles but UX should expose them directly.
Plan:
Expand type palette in BlockEditor toolbar to include headings, list items, bullet lists (maybe treat lists as dedicated block type with child bullet nodes).
Update renderer styles to render these roles distinctly (font size, bullet markers).
For bullet lists, decide on structure: either block with children representing list items or treat block.type = 'list' and parse markdown-style content. Need spec before implementation.
Also need serialization support so ucp-content recognizes new types and ensures round trips to Markdown/JSON stay consistent.
